# CV-Creator

A React+Redux application that enables the user to log in through its LinkedIn account, and use their already existing data to
create a custom CV template and convert it to PDF.

Technologies used:
- react - Main app framework
- react-redux - App state management
- react-intl - Internationalization
- react-router - Router
- reselect - Redux selectors
- lodash - Utility library
- SASS - styling
- Typescript - Main language

## Features so far
- Created a simple TODO App (Home screen) so I could test the React+Redux libraries
- Right now I'm working on the LinkedIn login page

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
The app is ready to be deployed!
